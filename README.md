### Introduction

Liam and I worked in a pair to create a front-end web application. We chose to use NASA's APIs to include data from the Mars Rover and images from Astronomy Picture of the Day. It is an informational web application, where the APIs can be searched by date.

### Controls (not necessary)

### Instructions

When the application loads, you enter a launchpad home page where the user can select to either enter the Mars Rover section or Astronomy Picture of the Day.

The Mars Rover index page is (something) by date, and displays all of the images available from that search.

If an image is selected, you enter the Mars Rover show page, where the image is selected and information about when that miage was taken and what camera was it taken from is displayed.

## Process

1. The first step was to install the neccassary packages required for the project, using npm.
2. Once the dependancies were installed, we then created a very basic one page app to make sure everything was up and running.
3. With the basic app structure was complete we then created an axios request to pull data from one of the APIs
